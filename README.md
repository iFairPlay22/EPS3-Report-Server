# EPS-3

## Mission statement 

Create a surveyor robot that can detect primary / first-order thermal and structural building defects, analyze them and display them to an operator.

## Goals
 
•	Do some research about 
•	Existing solutions on the market
•	Structural anomalies
•	Thermal defects 
•	Create an analysis system to detect building defects like
•	Thermal leaks
•	Cracks
•	Moisture (if time allows)
•	Blisters (if time allows)
•	Make a proof of concept for the robot
•	Design part
•	Creating a working robot 
•	Devise a system to display a report for the operators
•	User friendly
•	Ergonomic 
•	Get information from the robot
•	Semi-autonomous for one side of a wall
 
## Scope

•	The robot won't be fully autonomous 
•	We will use a controller
•	We will consider other objects in front of the wall only if time allows.
•	Analysis will only focus on blisters and moisture as well if time allows.
•	Consider the history of the data on a building if time allows
